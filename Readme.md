# Capstan-Driven Quadruped Leg Mechanism

## Overview
This project explores the design of a capstan drive–based quadruped leg mechanism aimed at achieving smooth, backlash-free joint actuation suitable for legged robotic systems.

## Motivation
Gear-driven joints often introduce backlash, which negatively affects force control and motion smoothness in legged robots. Achieving low-backlash performance using high-precision gear systems is both complex and expensive, making such solutions less accessible for personal and research-oriented projects. Capstan-driven actuation offers a lightweight, low-backlash alternative that enables smoother, more predictable torque transmission and coordinated joint motion, motivating its exploration in robotic mechanisms.

## Current Progress
- Studied capstan mechanics and derived the capstan equation
- Reviewed physical interpretations using pulley and winch analogies
- Analyzed the role of static vs kinetic friction in holding and motion
- Clarified the dynamic nature of tight and loose sides in symmetric systems

## Next Steps
- Build physical and conceptual intuition by extending understanding from a single-rope pulley system to a capstan-based transmission
- Translate this understanding into a Stage-1 capstan actuator design in Fusion 360, with an emphasis on visualizing smooth and backlash-free motion through animation
- Study the kinematic principles of five-bar linkages and begin conceptual integration with the capstan-driven actuation system
