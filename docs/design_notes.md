## Capstan Mechanics – Initial Understanding

Equations alone did not provide sufficient intuition for capstan mechanics. To build a physical understanding, I explored analogous systems such as winches and pulley-based load lifting setups.

Key insights:
- Tight and loose sides are not fixed and depend on the direction of attempted motion
- Friction increases force required for motion but reduces force required for holding
- Static friction plays a crucial role in posture holding in robotic joints

These insights motivated translating theory into an initial actuator concept.

## Capstan Drive – Initial CAD Implementation

An initial capstan drive was modeled in Fusion 360 to visualize the geometric and kinematic behavior of cable-based torque transmission. The model consists of two drums connected by a continuous cable, with the input drum acting as the capstan and the output drum representing a joint pulley.

### Geometry and Design Choices
- The input drum was modeled with a radius of 10 mm, while the output drum uses a larger radius of 80 mm to demonstrate torque–speed scaling through geometry rather than gears.
- Both drums include helical grooves sized for a 4 mm cable. The helical profile allows the cable to progress axially during multiple wraps and prevents lateral instability during rotation.
- A large wrap angle (approximately seven turns) was intentionally used in this initial model to clearly visualize the capstan effect and ensure stable cable contact.

### Motion Representation
The model uses revolute joints for both drums, with joint motion linked kinematically to demonstrate rotational transmission. Cable behavior is represented geometrically through a defined path rather than through physical simulation of tension or friction.

### Physical Interpretation
While the CAD model does not simulate frictional forces or cable tension, it reinforces the following physical insights:
- Torque transmission occurs through tension differences in the cable generated by friction at the drum interfaces.
- During static holding, friction can sustain large tension differences without relative motion.
- During continuous motion, relative sliding between the cable and drum surfaces is unavoidable, leading to energy loss despite continuous contact.

## Five-Bar Linkage – Mechanical Modeling

A planar five-bar linkage was modeled to study closed-chain leg kinematics and endpoint motion. The linkage was constructed with realistic dimensions and fully assembled using revolute joints.

### Link Geometry
- Input and passive links were modeled with approximately 150 mm length and 15 mm width.
- All links were treated as rigid bodies and assembled into a closed-loop configuration.
- Symmetric placement of the base joints was used to simplify motion behavior and maintain balanced kinematics.

### Assembly and Motion
- Two base joints act as the actuated inputs of the five-bar linkage.
- Passive links connect the input links to a common end-effector point.
- The closed-chain constraint was verified by manually driving the input joints and observing smooth, constrained motion of the end-effector.

### Observations
- End-effector motion depends on coordinated motion of both input joints.
- Symmetric actuation produces cleaner and more predictable trajectories.

## Concentric Base Actuation – Design Decision

While implementing the five-bar linkage, a packaging issue arose when attempting to actuate both base joints while maintaining symmetry and compactness.

### Problem
The five-bar linkage requires two independently actuated base joints. Placing two separate motors at different base locations complicates symmetry and increases spatial spread.

### Implemented Approach
- Two concentric input links were modeled at the base.
- One input link is fixed to a central shaft.
- The second input link is mounted concentrically and rotates independently, sliding over the same shaft.
- One capstan drum includes a central bore for the shaft, while the other input link is driven directly through the shaft.

This arrangement allows both input links to rotate independently while remaining concentric, enabling a compact and symmetric base configuration.
