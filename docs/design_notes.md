## Capstan Mechanics – Initial Understanding

Equations alone did not provide sufficient intuition for capstan mechanics. To build a physical understanding, I explored analogous systems such as winches and pulley-based load lifting setups.

Key insights:
- Tight and loose sides are not fixed and depend on the direction of attempted motion
- Friction increases force required for motion but reduces force required for holding
- Static friction plays a crucial role in posture holding in robotic joints

These insights motivated translating theory into an initial actuator concept.

## Capstan Drive – Initial CAD Implementation

An initial capstan drive was modeled in Fusion 360 to visualize the geometric and kinematic behavior of cable-based torque transmission. The model consists of two drums connected by a continuous cable, with the input drum acting as the capstan and the output drum representing a joint pulley.

### Geometry and Design Choices
- The input drum was modeled with a radius of 10 mm, while the output drum uses a larger radius of 80 mm to demonstrate torque–speed scaling through geometry rather than gears.
- Both drums include helical grooves sized for a 4 mm cable. The helical profile allows the cable to progress axially during multiple wraps and prevents lateral instability during rotation.
- A large wrap angle (approximately seven turns) was intentionally used in this initial model to clearly visualize the capstan effect and ensure stable cable contact.

### Motion Representation
The model uses revolute joints for both drums, with joint motion linked kinematically to demonstrate rotational transmission. Cable behavior is represented geometrically through a defined path rather than through physical simulation of tension or friction.

### Physical Interpretation
While the CAD model does not simulate frictional forces or cable tension, it reinforces the following physical insights:
- Torque transmission occurs through tension differences in the cable generated by friction at the drum interfaces.
- During static holding, friction can sustain large tension differences without relative motion.
- During continuous motion, relative sliding between the cable and drum surfaces is unavoidable, leading to energy loss despite continuous contact.
