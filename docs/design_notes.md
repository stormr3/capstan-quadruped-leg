## Capstan Mechanics – Initial Understanding

Equations alone did not provide sufficient intuition for capstan mechanics. To build a physical understanding, I explored analogous systems such as winches and pulley-based load lifting setups.

Key insights:
- Tight and loose sides are not fixed and depend on the direction of attempted motion
- Friction increases force required for motion but reduces force required for holding
- Static friction plays a crucial role in posture holding in robotic joints

These insights motivated translating theory into an initial actuator concept.
